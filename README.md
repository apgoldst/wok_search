Automating Web of Science/Knowledge searches
============================================

Here are three ways to query Web of Science/Knowledge. Automating GET request like in wok-search.py is the easiest to handle, but the API used in wos-lamr.py is always the fastest if the Web of Science subset is sufficient. The SOAP appraoch in wos-soap.py is a fork from [the gist domoritz/wos.php](https://gist.github.com/domoritz/2012629) I tested, with slight modifications.
