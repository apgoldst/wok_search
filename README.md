Automating searching of Web of Science/Knowledge
================================================

Here are three ways to query Web of Science/Knowledge. Automating GET request like in wok-search.py is the easiest to handle, but the API used in wos-lamr.py is always the fastest if the Web of Science subset is sufficient. The SOAP appraoch in wos-soap.py is a fork from domoritz/wos.php I tested, with slight modifications.
